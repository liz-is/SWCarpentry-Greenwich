Epigenetics
===========

Epigenetics is a controversial term.

Waddington's epigenetic landscape concept: this comes from a famous image and relates to the development of many cells and cell types from a zygote.

Adrian Bird: epigenetics is what you call it when you don't know what's going on

"like a nice rug: you just sweep everything under it" - I don't remember who said this

Epigenetics definitions are very variable, and have changed over time. Perhaps we should retire this word - but there are whole journals named after it.

Aspects of epigenetics:

- histones
- DNA methylation

This is a change made on the internet. I like tea.
